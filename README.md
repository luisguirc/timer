# Chronometer and timer

A page with two buttons to access two different functionalities:
- Timer, in which the user selects an interval and receives an alert when time is over.
- Chronometer, in which the user can trigger the start. Once triggered, the user can click on a button to pause it, and once paused, unpause it or reset it.
